You will be building a simple webpage "My To Do list" which contains all of the tasks that you have to finish.

Requirements: 
As a user, I would like to add my tasks to the list so I can track my tasks.
- Create a form in order to add a small task description, task due date, and task urgency. the urgency should be one of a predefined list that contains the following: 
Low, Medium, High
- Make sure to add form validation from the HTML part.

As a user, I would like to view all of my tasks that I already added so that I can quickly view my tasks list.
- Whenever you add a task using the form, you should use the local storage in order to get all the tasks from it and render them as a table using DOM.

**Stretch Goal One:** As a user, I would like to delete any task so I can handle my tasks list all the time.
- When you press on the 'X', the task should be deleted from the DOM and the local storage.

**Stretch Goal Two:** As a user, I would like to have the option to clear all of the tasks as a bulk, the cleared tasks should reflect on the table.
- Create a button that will clear all the items from the localstorage and the DOM.


#### Do this work on the 'master' branch.
